# Random Fighters
A multiplayer top-down strategy game that changes each round.

Random Fighters (RF) is a project made using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) 4.4.1. This is an open source project made for fun (and for a few of my friends!). Feel free to use the assets found in this project in any way you like. Credits would be appreciated as well.

This project is also a W.I.P.

# Instalation
- Download [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (4.4.1 recommended)
- Open this project in Godot
- Have fun!

# Matchmaking
In order to restore functionality to the matchmaking system you'll have to setup your own backend service (or websocket in my case) to handle the database. Alternatively, you can use p2p connection and remove matchmaking altogether, since this project uses UPnP to host servers.
